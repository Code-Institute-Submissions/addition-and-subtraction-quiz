# Addition and Subtraction Quiz

This is a responzive maths quiz app for primary school children built for the interactive front end development project of my Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course. 

## Spec

Each time a user plays they are given ten random addition and subtraction questions. Before they start the can pick one of ten levels of difficulty, ranging from numbers 1-10 to 1-100. The user has to pick the correct answer from four numbers, which are all of a near magnitude. At the end they are given a score out of ten.

## Installation
For the app to work you need to download the following files-
* index.html
* assets folder - this contains a css folder containing the file style.css, and a js folder containing the files jquery-3.3.1 and script.js

Then open index.html to run the app.

## Tests
During development I was constantly console logging all the variable to make sure they delivered the expected results. Variables were also changed to constants to make results were as expected. And then it was rigorous testing to make sure ever possible combination of button clicks still delivered the expected results and scores.

The responsiveness was tested using responinator.com

## Built With
* jquery 3.3.1.- controls behaviour of buttons
* Google fonts - Baloo+Bhai|Roboto
